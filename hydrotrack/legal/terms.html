                <a>9.1 We always endeavor to ensure that the services of HydroTrack are available without interruption and that transmissions are error-free. However, due to the nature of the Internet, this cannot be guaranteed. Your access to HydroTrack's services may also be interrupted or restricted from time to time to allow for repairs, maintenance or the introduction of new facilities. We will try to limit the frequency and duration of any such temporary interruptions or restrictions.
                <br>
                </a><a>9.2 HydroTrack shall be liable without limitation insofar as the cause of the damage is based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by HydroTrack or a legal representative or vicarious agent of HydroTrack.
                <br>
                </a><a>9.3 Furthermore, HydroTrack shall be liable for the slightly negligent breach of material obligations. Material obligations are obligations whose breach jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the contract or whose fulfillment makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on whose compliance you regularly rely. In this case, however, HydroTrack is only liable for the foreseeable damage typical for the contract. HydroTrack is not liable for the slightly negligent breach of obligations other than those mentioned in the preceding sentences.
                <br>
                </a><a>9.4 The above limitations of liability shall not apply in the event of injury to life, limb or health, for a defect following the assumption of a guarantee for the quality of the product and in the event of fraudulently concealed defects. Liability under the Product Liability Act remains unaffected.
                <br>
                </a><a>9.5 Insofar as the liability of HydroTrack is excluded or limited, this also applies to the personal liability of employees, representatives and vicarious agents.</a>
